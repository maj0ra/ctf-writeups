Day One Challenges
Walkthrough

1. What is the name of the cookie used for authentication?


• Register for an account on the “Christmas Console” webpage.
  ◇ For this exercise, I used Firefox. The steps will be mostly the same in any browser, minus the next step.
• Click on Firefox's “Settings” menu in the upper-right corner of the browser.
  ◇ Then click “Web Developer”
  ◇ Then “Storage Inspector”.
• The only cookie listed for this sitte is named “auth”.

ANSWER - AUTH

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2. In what format is the value of this cookie encoded?


Look at the value of the cookie:

7b22636f6d70616e79223a22546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c2022757365726e616d65223a22636f757274227d

At first glance, this looks like hexadecimal format. It's definitely a string comprised of both numbers and letters, and that hint gives us a place to start on determining the format.

How to verify that it *is* hexadecimal format:

• Go to CyberChef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
• Paste the value of the auth cookie into the “Input" pane of the CyberChef webapp.
• A “magic wand” icon should appear next to the word “Output” in the bottom pane of the CyberChef webapp.
  ◇ Click the “magic wand" to automatically convert the value to human-redable text.
• Check the “Recipe” pane in the center of the CyberChef webapp. The automatically selected conversion tool should say “From Hex”.

ANSWER - HEXADECIMAL

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


3. Having decoded the cookie, what format is the data stored in?


Here's the decoded auth cookie text:

{"company":"The Best Festival Company", "username":"court"}

The text is enclosed in brackets {}, and each data object inside the brackets has a type and a value separated by commas.

i.e. - company === type, “The Best Festival Company" === value.

This is exactly how a map is declared in JavaScript. Therefore, the answer must be JSON.

ANSWER - JSON


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


4. What is the value of Santa's cookie?



To get the new hexadecimal value, we need to remove the username “court” and replace it with “santa”.

{"company":"The Best Festival Company", "username":"santa"}

• Change the value in the “Output” pane of the CyberChef webapp.
• Copy the raw “Output” data to the clipboard.
• Click the trash can icon in the upper right corner of CyberChef to clear the previous input and recipe.
• Paste the new map declaration in the “Input" pane of CyberChef.
• Choose “To Hex” from the far left pane of CyberChef, and drag it into the “Recipe” column.
  ◇ Choose “None” for the delimiter in the “Recipe”, or there will be a space inserted after each 2 character pair.

Here's the value of Santa's cookie in hex:

7b22636f6d70616e79223a22546865204265737420466573746976616c20436f6d70616e79222c2022757365726e616d65223a2273616e7461227d


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you are the santa user, you can re-activate the assembly line!


In order to become the “Santa” user, you must copy/paste the value of Santa's cookie into the original auth cookie's “value” field in your web browser's developer console.

Click on the “Reload” button on your browser to bypass the authetication screen and log in as Santa!

Once you're in, you should see “switch” buttons next to each control. Click each switch to reactivate the assembly line.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


5. What is the flag you're given when the line is fully active?


Once you've clicked each switch to “On” and reactivated the assembly line, the final flag will be shown at the bottom of the "Christmas Console" webpage.
